Helpdesk and ticket system plugin for supporting your clients right from admin area. Your customers can reach you via email or by using the contact form.

== Description ==

If your users are confused and need help, how can you get that help to them? A help desk. Help desk software lets you accept client queries, organize them, and respond in a streamlined manner.

And the Catchers Helpdesk plugin lets you bring that functionality right into your WordPress dashboard. [Try Demo how it works](http://demo.mycatchers.com).

In addition to offering front-end ticket submission forms, **it can also automatically convert emails into tickets**. So every time someone emails [support@yousupport@yoursite.com](mailto:support@yousupport@yoursite.com) , you can automatically convert it into a ticket right in your WordPress dashboard.

= What Does the Catchers Helpdesk Plugin Do? =

Catchers Helpdesk sets you up with a full-service ticketing system. Users can either submit tickets from the front-end. Or, they can email you and the plugin will automatically convert those emails into tickets.

No matter how the ticket comes in, it will then show up as an active ticket in your WordPress dashboard. There, you can easily manage, respond to, or escalate any of the tickets.

Here’s everything you get with Catchers Helpdesk:

- **Front-end ticket submissions** - no need for your users to use the WordPress backend.
- **Email fetching** - the plugin will check an external email account and convert emails into tickets.
- **Categorize tickets** - create categories or tags to assign tickets to for better organization.
- **Reply templates** - easily respond to common questions with saved replies.
- **Conversation feed filtering -** filtering Conversations allow you to selectively view conversation messages by author and status.
- **Client management** - see each client’s support history and details.
- **Private notes** - make private notes on a client’s history page to remember specific details about them.
- **Filter tickets** - quickly filter tickets by topic, client, status, and more.
- **Custom fields** - add custom fields to your ticket submission form if you need additional data.
- **Contact form builder** - includes a tool to build your contact form (pro-feature).

Watch the video how it looks and works:

Once you activate Catchers Helpdesk, it will set you up with a handy startup wizard to get the basic details configured. First, you need to add your primary support email. This is where customers can email you questions if needed (remember, you’ll also be able to set up a dedicated front-end form).

Next, you need to configure your emails details so that the plugin can pull in tickets from your support email. You’ll need to enter your email server, port, and password. All these details are available in your hosting cPanel account.

Once you enter all of your details, the plugin lets you test the connection. Hopefully, you see a success message. That means the plugin was able to successfully connect to your email, a necessity for the cool email-to-ticket function it offers.

Finally, Catchers gives you the shortcode you’ll need to add your frontend submission form.

The plugin even pulls in the “From” name automatically to create a contact profile, which is a nice touch.

In the **Settings** page, you can choose how often the plugin checks for new emails. The default is one hour, but you can increase the frequency if desired. The minimum is every minute.

Finally, in the **Settings** tab, you can configure a number of features. Here’s some what you can configure:

- Allow users to upload file attachments
- Choose a default person to assign tickets to
- Configure how often to check for incoming mail
- Add a ticket link to notification emails so people can open the ticket in their browser
- Enable help catcher - a small icon that lets readers easy submit ticket

Well, it's time to [see Demo](http://demo.mycatchers.com) and try how it works.
