WordPress plugin, which creates a powerful ticket system right in the admin area of your WP site.

== Description ==

Every request sent to your support email becomes a ticket in your helpdesk . You can easily categorize and prioritize tickets and assign them to the right people in your team.

You don’t have to worry about multiple agents responding to the same ticket anymore because everyone in your team (user in admin area) can see who is working on each ticket, as well as it’s status.

= E-mail fetching =

Your potential clients can reach you via email or by using the contact form. You can respond to emails and your customers will receive immediate replies. Catchers Helpdesk will poll an external POP3/IMAP account on a regular basis, retrieve email messages and convert them to tickets.

= Saved replies =

Affordable and useful tool for saving you time. You can create saved reply if you answering the same question frequently. They can be utilized in any form of customer communication: from inquiry, to request, to support.

= Conversation feed filtering =

You can filter all conversations on the ticket page for the easier organization. Filtering Conversations allow you to selectively view conversation messages by author and status.

= Private notes =

Public comments can be read by anyone who has access to the ticket. You can also add private comments to tickets. These comments are only visible to other agents, not to the ticket requester or any other end-users.

= Ticket history =

A simple listing of the date and time a request was assigned to someone and who it was that assigned it as well as status changes. The activities feed in a ticket shows you a quick log of all the activities that have been happening on it.

= Tickets export =

You can export your tickets list to a CSV whenever you want to create custom reports or presentation for a manager.
